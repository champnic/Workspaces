This Privacy Policy applies to the Workspaces browser extension built by Mincho Labs (champnic@microsoft.com).

## Data we collect
The Workspaces extension uses various types of browsing data to enable its services. This includes the current tab urls you have open and what windows they are open in.

## How we collect data
We collect browser usage data using the Chrome or Edge extension APIs, specifically the [chrome.tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs)
and [chrome.windows](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/extension) APIs.
We will only collect data from the browser you installed the Workspaces extension on.

## How do we use this data
We use the data of your browsing to restore and manage your previous browsing sessions.
We only store data locally on the device you install the Workspaces extension on, using the HTML localStorage API.
It is never sent or saved externally (servers or other devices) from your device.

## Third Party access to data
We won't share your data with any third parties.

## Clearing your data
You can delete all data that the Workspaces extension uses by deleting your browser data with the 'Cookies and other site data' option selected.
